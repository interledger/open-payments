## What is Open Payments?

Open Payments is an open API standard that can be implemented by account servicing entities (e.g. banks, digital wallet providers, and mobile money providers) to facilitate interoperability in the setup and completion of payments for different use cases including:

- [Web Monetization](https://webmonetization.org)
- Tipping/Donations (low value/low friction)
- eCommerce checkout
- P2P transfers
- Subscriptions
- Invoice Payments

The Open Payments APIs are a collection of three sub-systems:

- A **wallet address server** which exposes public information about Open Payments-enabled accounts called "wallet addresses"
- A **resource server** which exposes APIs for performing functions against the underlying accounts
- A **authorisation server** which exposes APIs compliant with the [GNAP](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-gnap-core-protocol) standard for getting grants to access the resource server APIs

The three Open Payments OpenAPI specifications are found in the [open-payments-specifications](https://github.com/interledger/open-payments-specifications) repository, while this repository hosts the documentation for the APIs, published on [openpayments.dev](https://openpayments.dev). 

### Open Payments SDKs

The Open Payments SDKs provide developers with pre-built functions that simplify interactions with the Open Payments API.

Currently, we offer:
- [TypeScript/NodeJS SDK](https://github.com/interledger/open-payments-node/tree/main/packages/open-payments)
- [PHP SDK](https://github.com/interledger/open-payments-php)
- [Rust SDK](https://github.com/interledger/open-payments-rust)

with plans to expand to additional languages and frameworks in the future.
