:::note
Outgoing payments require an interactive grant. This type of grant will obtain the customer's consent before an outgoing payment is made against their wallet account. You can find more information in the [Open Payments flow](/introduction/op-flow/#outgoing-payment) and [identity providers](/introduction/idp) pages.
