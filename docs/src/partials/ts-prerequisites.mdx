**Create an authenticated Open Payments client**

Create an Open Payments-authenticated client by providing the following properties:

- `walletAddressURL` : your Open Payments-enabled wallet address that your client will use to authenticate itself to one or more authorization servers.
- `privateKey` : the EdDSA-Ed25519 key or preferably the absolute or relative file path to the key that is bound to your wallet address. A public key signed with this private
  key must be made available as a public JWK document at `{walletAddressUrl}/jwks.json` url.
- `keyId` : the identifier of the private key and the corresponding public key.
