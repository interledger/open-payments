Open Payments supports the payment methods listed below. Payment methods define the way funds are moved out of one Open Payments-enabled account and into another.

## Supported payment methods

### Interledger Protocol (ILP)

ILP is an open protocol suite for transferring packets of value between peers and across different payment networks or ledgers. The open architecture and minimal protocol enable interoperability for any value transfer system and is optimized for routing large volumes of low-value packets.

Refer to the <LinkOut href="https://interledger.org/developers/get-started/">ILP developer documentation</LinkOut> for more information.
