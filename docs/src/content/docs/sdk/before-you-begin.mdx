The Open Payments SDKs provide developers with pre-built functions that simplify interactions with the Open Payments API. Currently, we offer the following SDKs, with plans to expand to additional languages and frameworks in the future.

- <LinkOut href='https://github.com/interledger/open-payments-node'>TypeScript/NodeJS</LinkOut>
- <LinkOut href='https://github.com/interledger/open-payments-php'>PHP</LinkOut>
- <LinkOut href='https://github.com/interledger/open-payments-rust'>Rust</LinkOut>

## Using the SDKs

Each SDK snippet page uses a tabbed interface to support multiple programming languages. This means you can find the relevant code snippets for the language of your choice with ease, without needing individual pages for each language. The basic structure of each page is as follows:

- The page title reflects the operation, function, or action being performed.
- A few overview paragraphs provide context about the function, its role in the Open Payments flow, and any general information that may be helpful.
- The "Before you begin" section that links back to this page for steps to create a test wallet.
- The main content area includes the tabbed interface where you can select your preferred programming language.

In the tabbed interface, you'll notice the following sections:

- A "Prerequisites" button that links to the respective SDK's README on GitHub for setup instructions.
- Any additional configuration steps required for the selected language.
- Code blocks for each step in the process, broken down into manageable chunks.
- After the code snippets, any other commands that need to be run are mentioned, along with links to the relevant API reference documentation or other pertinent resources.

This consistent structure across all SDK snippet pages allow you to quickly grasp the functionality and implementation details, making it easier to work with the Open Payments SDKs.

## Create an account on the test wallet

Before working with our SDK snippets, we recommend creating a <LinkOut href='https://wallet.interledger-test.dev/'>test wallet account</LinkOut> on the Interledger test network.

The test wallet lets you create accounts, funded with play money, and developer keys for making Interledger transactions via the Open Payments APIs.

1. Go to <LinkOut href="https://wallet.interledger-test.dev">wallet.interledger-test.dev</LinkOut>.
2. Click **Create account** at the bottom-right of the screen.
3. Enter your email address, a strong password, then confirm the password. Click the arrowhead.
4. Go to your inbox and look for an email sent by `tech@interledger.org` with the subject "[Test.Wallet] Verify your account". Click **Confirm my email address.**
5. Click **Login to your account** at the email verification screen.
6. Log in with your credentials.
7. Complete the Know Your Customer (KYC) steps. The only real information you need to share is your email address. All other information can be fake.
   :::note[Why are there so many KYC steps?]
   The Interledger test wallet environment is running on a GateHub pre-production environment. The pre-production environment mimics the production environment, including many of the <LinkOut href="https://support.gatehub.net/hc/en-us/articles/360021131234-KYC-requirements-for-account-verification">KYC steps</LinkOut>.

You're now ready to create a test wallet and deposit money!

    You now have a funded test wallet!

## Add a wallet address to your account

1. Select the account from the Test Wallet dashboard.
2. Click **Add wallet address**.
   <img src='/img/snippets/tw-acct-options.png' alt='Account options screen showing buttons for add wallet address and deposit' class='img-outline' style='max-width:400px'/>
3. Enter a **Wallet Address name** and a **Public name** of your choosing.
   <img src='/img/snippets/tw-create-wallet-address.png' alt='Create wallet address screen with fields for wallet address name and public name' class='img-outline' style='max-width:400px'/>
4. Click **Create**. Your account now has a wallet address.

## Obtain a public-private key pair and key ID

Before you can initialize an authenticated Open Payments client, you must obtain a public-private key pair and a key ID.

1. Click **Settings** in the left sidebar on the dashboard.
2. Click the **Developer Keys** tab.
3. Expand the menu for your wallet account.

4. Click **Generate public & private key**.
5. Enter any **nickname** for the key pair, then click **Generate keys**. A file named `private.key` automatically downloads to your machine
      <img src='/img/snippets/tw-generate-key-pair.png' alt='Generate public and private key screen with nickname field' class='img-outline' style='max-width:400px'/>
<img src='/img/snippets/tw-key-pair-success.png' alt='Key pair generation success screen' class='img-outline' style='max-width:400px'/>
6. Click **Close**. Your key ID appears on the screen, along with a **Show/Hide** option for your public key.
   <img src='/img/snippets/tw-key-id.png' alt='Developer keys tab with account expanded, showing the newly generated key id and an option to show the public key' class='img-outline' style='max-width:400px'/>

You can now use your keys and wallet address to initialize an authenticated Open Payments client.
