import { LinkOut } from '@interledger/docs-design-system'

Before working with our code snippets, we recommend creating a wallet account on the <LinkOut href='https://wallet.interledger-test.dev/'>test wallet</LinkOut> that's part of the Interledger testnet.

The test wallet lets you create developer keys and wallet accounts, funded with play money, for making Interledger transactions via the Open Payments APIs.

## Create an account on the test wallet

1. Go to <LinkOut href="https://wallet.interledger-test.dev">wallet.interledger-test.dev</LinkOut>.
2. Click **Create account** at the bottom-right of the screen.
3. Enter your e-mail address, a strong password, then confirm the password. Click the arrowhead.
4. Go to your inbox and look for an e-mail sent by `tech@interledger.org` with the subject "[Test.Wallet] Verify your account". Click **Confirm my email address.**
5. Click **Login to your account** at the email verification screen.
6. Log in with your credentials.
7. Complete the Know Your Customer (KYC) steps. The only real information you need to share is your email address. All other information can be fake.
   :::note[Why are there so many KYC steps?]
   The Interledger test wallet environment is running on a GateHub pre-production environment. The pre-production environment mimics the production environment, including many of the <LinkOut href="https://support.gatehub.net/hc/en-us/articles/360021131234-KYC-requirements-for-account-verification">KYC steps</LinkOut>.

You're now ready to create a test wallet and add money to it!

6. Enter an amount between 50 to 1,000 to deposit into the account, then click **Deposit**.

   :::caution
   The minimum deposit amount is 50. Though you can enter an amount larger than 1,000, total deposits exceeding 10,000 within 24 hours will be subject to manual review and approval. Thus, to avoid delays, it is advised that each deposit be limited to 1,000 to allow multiple deposits within a 24-hour period automatically.
