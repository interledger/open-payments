A quote is a commitment from an account servicing entity to deliver a particular amount to a payee when sending a particular amount from a payer. Once an authorized client obtains the requisite grant from the payer’s authorization server, the client can create a quote resource against the payer’s wallet address. The quote indicates how much it will cost the payer to proceed with the transaction.

These code snippets create a quote with a fixed receive amount of $10 USD, meaning the payee (recipient) should receive $10 USD after any applicable fees. The debit amount, which is the amount to be deducted from the payer’s account, is also $10 USD, indicating there are no fees associated with this quote.
