:::tip[Summary]
An identity provider (IdP) is a system or service that manages user authentication and consent during the interactive grant process.
:::

Open Payments requires any authorization server that issues interactive grants to be integrated with an IdP.

An interactive grant is a grant that requires explicit user interaction/consent from the resource owner before an access token can be issued. In Open Payments, an interactive grant must be issued before an outgoing payment resource can be created.

After the interactive grant request is initiated and the authorization server sets the session, the server provides the client with the IdP URI in which to redirect the user.

The following diagram illustrates the flow of an interactive grant.
