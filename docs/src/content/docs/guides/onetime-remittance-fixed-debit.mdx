:::tip[Summary]
Learn how to send a one-time remittance payment by debiting the sender's account by a specific amount.
:::

A remittance payment is a transfer of money from one person to another, typically across borders or long distances, often involving currency conversion and fees. In this guide, you will learn how to implement a one-time remittance payment feature where your users can specify exactly how much they want to pay, rather than how much the recipient should receive.

This approach is particularly useful for remittance app scenarios where:

- Your users want to pay a fixed amount from their account
- The recipient receives whatever amount remains after fees and currency conversion
- Your users want to avoid the complexity of calculating fees upfront

### Scenario

Imagine someone in the US sending money to a family member in Mexico. They want to send exactly $100 US Dollars (`USD`) from their account, regardless of how much their family member actually receives after fees and exchange rates. This is different from sending money where the sender specifies exactly how much the recipient should receive.

For this guide, you'll assume the role of a developer building a remittance app. The guide explains how to send a $100 `USD` payment, where the sender pays exactly $100, and the recipient receives the amount in Mexican Pesos (`MXN`) after all fees and currency conversion.

**Example transaction details:**

- **Sender pays**: $100.00 `USD` (exact amount)
- **Fees**: $5.00 `USD` (5% processing fee)
- **Currency conversion**: `USD` to `MXN` at 17.00 exchange rate
- **Recipient receives**: $1,615.00 `MXN` (($100 - $5) Ã— 17.00)

The three parties involved in this scenario are:

- **Developer**: you, the person building the remittance app
- **Sender**: the person using your app to send money in `USD`
- **Recipient**: the person receiving the money in `MXN`

Remember, Open Payments doesn't execute payments or touch money in any way. It's used to issue payment instructions before any money movement occurs. An example of a payment instruction is, "debit exactly $100 from the sender's account and send it to the recipient's account, where they will receive $1,615.00 `MXN` after $5 in fees and `USD` to `MXN` conversion."

## Steps

### 1. Get wallet address information

When your user initiates a payment through your remittance app, you need to get wallet address information for both the sender and the recipient.

Let's assume your user has already provided their own wallet address when they signed up to use your app. Let's also assume the sender entered the recipient's wallet address into your app's payment form when initiating the payment.

Call the <Badge text="GET" variant="note" /> [Get Wallet Address API](/apis/wallet-address-server/operations/get-wallet-address) for each address.

<Tabs syncKey="lang">
<TabItem label='TypeScript/JavaScript' icon='seti:javascript'>
  ```ts
  const senderWalletAddress = await client.walletAddress.get({
    url: 'https://cloudninebank.example.com/sender'
  })
  const recipientWalletAddress = await client.walletAddress.get({
    url: 'https://happylifebank.example.com/recipient'
  })
```

The following shows an example response from the sender's wallet provider. A similar response will be returned from the recipient's wallet provider.
```json wrap
{
  "id": "https://cloudninebank.example.com/sender",
  "assetCode": "USD",
  "assetScale": 2,
  "authServer": "https://auth.cloudninebank.example.com/",
  "resourceServer": "https://cloudninebank.example.com/op"
}
```
</details>

### 2. Request an incoming payment grant

Use the recipient's `authServer` details, received in the previous step, to call the <Badge text="POST" variant="success" /> [Grant Request API](/apis/auth-server/operations/post-request).

This call obtains an access token that allows your app to request that an incoming payment resource be created on the recipient's wallet account.

<Tabs syncKey="lang">
<TabItem label='TypeScript/JavaScript' icon='seti:javascript'>
  ```ts wrap
  const recipientIncomingPaymentGrant = await client.grant.request(
    {
      url: recipientWalletAddress.authServer
    },
    {
      access_token: {
        access: [
          {
            type: "incoming-payment",
            actions: ["read", "create"],
          },
        ],
      },
    },
  );
````
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

<details>
<summary>Example response</summary>

    },
    "uri": "https://happylifebank.example.com/continue/{...}" // continuation request uri
  }
}
```

</details>

### 3. Request the creation of an incoming payment resource

Use the access token returned in the previous response to call the <Badge text="POST" variant="success" /> [Create Incoming Payment API](/apis/resource-server/operations/create-incoming-payment).

This call requests an incoming payment resource be created on the recipient's wallet account.

<Tabs syncKey="lang">
  <TabItem label='TypeScript/JavaScript' icon='seti:javascript'>
  ```ts wrap
  const recipientIncomingPayment = await client.incomingPayment.create(
    {
      url: recipientWalletAddress.resourceServer,
      accessToken: recipientIncomingPaymentGrant.access_token.value
    },
    {
      walletAddress: recipientWalletAddress.id
    },
  )
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

<details>
<summary>Example response</summary>
The following shows an example response from the recipient's wallet provider.

```json wrap

  "receivedAmount": {
    "value": "0",
    "assetCode": "USD",
    "assetScale": 2
  },
  "completed": false,
  "createdAt": "2025-03-12T23:20:50.52Z",
  "methods": [
    {
      "type": "ilp",
      "ilpAddress": "...",
      "sharedSecret": "..."
    }
  ]
}
```

</details>

### 4. Request a quote grant

Use the sender's `authServer` details, received in Step 1, to call the <Badge text="POST" variant="success" /> [Grant Request API](/apis/auth-server/operations/post-request).

This call obtains an access token that allows your app to request that a quote resource be created on the sender's wallet account.

<Tabs syncKey="lang">
  <TabItem label='TypeScript/JavaScript' icon='seti:javascript'>
    ```ts wrap
    const senderQuoteGrant = await client.grant.request(
      {
        url: senderWalletAddress.authServer
      },
      {
        access_token: {
          access: [
            {
              type: 'quote',
              actions: ['create', 'read']
            }
          ]
        }
      }
    )
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

<details>
  <summary>Example response</summary>

```json wrap
{
  "access_token": {
    "value": "...", // access token value for quote grant
    "manage": "https://cloudninebank.example.com/token/{...}", // management uri for access token
    "access": [
      {
        "type": "quote",
        "actions": ["create", "read"]
      }
    ]
  },
  "continue": {
    "access_token": {
      "value": "..." // access token for continuing the request
    },
    "uri": "https://auth.cloudninebank.example.com/continue/{...}" // continuation request uri
  }
}
```

</details>

### 5. Request the creation of a quote resource

Use the access token, received in the previous step, to call the <Badge text="POST" variant="success" /> [Create Quote API](/apis/resource-server/operations/create-quote).

This call requests that a quote resource be created on the sender's wallet account. The request must contain the `receiver`, which is the recipient's incoming payment `id`, along with the `debitAmount`, which is the exact amount the sender wants to pay.

The `debitAmount` specifies that the sender will pay exactly $100 USD, and the recipient will receive whatever amount remains after all fees and currency conversion.

<Tabs syncKey="lang">
<TabItem label='TypeScript/JavaScript' icon='seti:javascript'>
  ```ts wrap
  const senderQuote = await client.quote.create(
    {
      url: senderWalletAddress.resourceServer,
      accessToken: senderQuoteGrant.access_token.value
    },
    {
      method: 'ilp',
      walletAddress: senderWalletAddress.id,
      receiver: recipientIncomingPayment.id,
      debitAmount: {
        value: '10000', // $100.00 USD
        assetCode: 'USD',
        assetScale: 2
      }
    }
  )
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

The response returns a `receiveAmount`, a `debitAmount`, and other required information.

- `debitAmount` - The amount the sender must pay (exactly $100.00 USD in our example).
- `receiveAmount` - The amount the recipient will actually receive ($1,650.00 MXN in our example) after fees and currency conversion.

<details>
<summary>Example response</summary>
  The following shows an example response from the sender's wallet provider.

```json wrap
{
  "id": "https://cloudninebank.example.com/quotes/{...}", // url identifying the quote
  "walletAddress": "https://cloudninebank.example.com/sender",
  "receiver": "https://happylifebank.example.com/incoming-payments/{...}", // url of the incoming payment the quote is created for
  "debitAmount": {
    "value": "10000", // Sender pays exactly $100.00 USD
    "assetCode": "USD",
    "assetScale": 2
  },
  "receiveAmount": {
    "value": "161500", // Recipient receives 1,615.00 MXN after fees and currency conversion
    "assetCode": "MXN",
    "assetScale": 2
  },
  "method": "ilp",
  "createdAt": "2025-03-12T23:22:51.50Z"
}
```

</details>

### 6. Request an interactive outgoing payment grant

Use the sender's `authServer` information received in Step 1 to call the <Badge text="POST" variant="success" /> [Grant Request API](/apis/auth-server/operations/post-request).

This call obtains an access token that allows your app to request that an outgoing payment resource be created on the sender's wallet account.

<InteractionReq />

<Tabs syncKey="lang">
<TabItem label='TypeScript/JavaScript' icon='seti:javascript'>
  ```ts wrap
  const pendingSenderOutgoingPaymentGrant = await client.grant.request(
    {
      url: senderWalletAddress.authServer
    },
    {
      access_token: {
        access: [
          {
            identifier: senderWalletAddress.id,
            type: 'outgoing-payment',
            actions: ['read', 'create'],
            limits: {
              debitAmount: {
                assetCode: 'USD',
                assetScale: 2,
                value: quote.debitAmount.value, // 10000
              }
            }
          }
        ]
      },
      interact: {
        start: ['redirect'],
        finish: {
          method: 'redirect',
          uri: 'https://myapp.example.com/finish/{...}', // where to redirect your user after they've completed the interaction
          nonce: NONCE
        }
      }
    }
  )
  ```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

<details>
  <summary>Example response</summary>

```json wrap
{
  "interact": {
    "redirect": "https://auth.cloudninebank.example.com/{...}", // uri to redirect the sender to, to begin interaction
    "finish": "..." // unique key to secure the callback
  },
  "continue": {
    "access_token": {
      "value": "..." // access token for continuing the outgoing payment grant request
    },
    "uri": "https://auth.cloudninebank.example.com/continue/{...}", // uri for continuing the outgoing payment grant request
    "wait": 30
  }
}
```

</details>

### 7. Start interaction with the user

<StartInteraction />

### 8. Finish interaction with the user

<FinishInteraction />

### 9. Request a grant continuation

In our example, we're assuming the IdP your user interacted with has a user interface. When the interaction completes, your user returns to your app. Now your app can make a continuation request for the outgoing payment grant.

:::note
In a scenario where a user interface isn't available, consider implementing a polling mechanism to check for the completion of the interaction.
:::

Call the <Badge text="POST" variant="success" /> [Grant Continuation Request API](/apis/auth-server/operations/post-continue). This call requests an access token that allows your app to request that an outgoing payment resource be created on the sender's wallet account.

Issue the request to the `continue.uri` provided in the initial outgoing payment grant response (Step 6).

Include the `interact_ref` returned in the redirect URI's query parameters.

<Tabs syncKey="lang">
  <TabItem label='TypeScript/JavaScript' icon='seti:javascript'>
    ```ts wrap
    const senderOutgoingPaymentGrant = await client.grant.continue(
      {
        url: pendingSenderOutgoingPaymentGrant.continue.uri,
        accessToken: pendingSenderOutgoingPaymentGrant.continue.access_token.value
      },
      {
        interact_ref: interactRef
      }
    )
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

<details>
  <summary>Example response</summary>

```json wrap
{
  "access_token": {
    "value": "...", // final access token required before creating outgoing payments
    "manage": "https://auth.cloudninebank.example.com/token/{...}", // management uri for access token
    "access": [
      {
        "type": "outgoing-payment",
        "actions": ["create", "read"],
        "identifier": "https://cloudninebank.example.com/sender",
        "limits": {
          "receiver": "https://happylifebank.example.com/incoming-payments/{...}" // url of the incoming payment that's being paid
        }
      }
    ]
  },
  "continue": {
    "access_token": {
      "value": "..." // access token for continuing the request
    },
    "uri": "https://auth.cloudninebank.example.com/continue/{...}" // continuation request uri
  }
}
```

</details>

### 10. Request the creation of an outgoing payment resource

Recall that the Create Quote API response (Step 5) included a `debitAmount` and a `receiveAmount`. The response also included an `id` which is a URL to identify the quote.

Because the quote contains debit and receive amounts, we won't specify any other amounts when setting up the outgoing payment. Instead, we will specify a `quoteId`.

Use the access token returned in Step 9 to call the <Badge text="POST" variant="success" /> [Create Outgoing Payment API](/apis/resource-server/operations/create-outgoing-payment). Include the `quoteId` in the request.

<Tabs syncKey="lang">
<TabItem label='TypeScript/JavaScript' icon='seti:javascript'>
  ```ts wrap
  const senderOutgoingPayment = await client.outgoingPayment.create(
    {
      url: senderWalletAddress.resourceServer,
      accessToken: senderOutgoingPaymentGrant.access_token.value
    },
    {
      walletAddress: senderWalletAddress.id,
      quoteId: senderQuote.id
    }
  )
```
