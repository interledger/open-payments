The Open Payments APIs facilitate multiple uses cases for payments to and from different Open Payments-enabled wallets. In this guide we look at the steps for making recurring payments.

An example use case for making recurring payments may be a Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL) scheme where a payer purchases a high priced item but pays for it in installments over regularly scheduled intervals.

## Steps

### 1. Import dependencies

Import `createAuthenticatedClient` from the Open Payments SDK package.

<ChunkedSnippet
  source='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/interledger/open-payments-snippets/main/incoming-payment/incoming-payment-create.ts'
  chunk='1'
/>

### 2. Create an authenticated Open Payments client

Create an Open Payments-authenticated client by providing the following properties:

- `walletAddressURL` : your Open Payments-enabled wallet address that your client will use to authenticate itself to one or more authorization servers.
- `privateKey` : the EdDSA-Ed25519 key or preferably the absolute or relative file path to the key that is bound to your wallet address. A public key signed with this private
  key must be made available as a public JWK document at `{walletAddressUrl}/jwks.json` url.
- `keyId` : the identifier of the private key and the corresponding public key.

  chunk='2'
/>

### 3. Request an Incoming Payment grant

Request an `incomingPayment` grant from the recipient wallet's authorization server.

<ChunkedSnippet
  source='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/interledger/open-payments-snippets/main/grant/grant-incoming-payment.ts'
  chunk='4'
/>

### 4. Create an Incoming Payment

Create an `incomingPayment` on the recipient wallet's resource server using the access token returned by the authorization server in the grant request and specify the `walletAddress` with the URL of the recipient's wallet.

Add the `incomingAmount` object and define the following properties:

- `value` : the maximum allowable amount that will be paid to the recipient's wallet address.
- `assetCode` : the ISO 4217 currency code representing the underlying asset used to make the payment.
- `assetScale` : the scale of amounts denoted in the corresponding asset code.

Optionally you may add the `expiresAt` property which is the date and time after which payments to the incoming payments will no longer be accepted.

  chunk='3'
/>

### 5. Request a Quote grant

Request a `quote` grant from the sender wallet's authorization server.

<ChunkedSnippet
  source='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/interledger/open-payments-snippets/main/grant/grant-quote.ts'
  chunk='4'
/>

### 6. Create a Quote

Create a `quote` on the sender wallet's resource server using the access token returned by the authorization server in the grant request.

Add the following properties:

- `method` : the payment method used to facilitate the payment. Set this property to `ilp` as Open Payments only supports <LinkOut href='https://interledger.org'>Interledger</LinkOut> payments at this time.
- `walletAddress` : the URL of the sender's wallet address.
- `receiver` : the URL of the incoming payment that will receive the payment.

<ChunkedSnippet
  source='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/interledger/open-payments-snippets/main/quote/quote-create.ts'
  chunk='3'
/>

### 7. Request an Outgoing Payment grant

Request an `outgoingPayment` grant from the sender wallet's authorization server.

Add the `limits` object with the following properties:

- `debitAmount` : the maximum amount to be deducted from the sender's wallet.
- `receiveAmount` : the maximum amount to be received in the recipient's wallet.
- `interval` : the interval period conforming to the <LinkOut href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Repeating_intervals">ISO8601 repeating interval string format.</LinkOut>

:::note
This request requires an interactive grant as the sender will need to consent before an `outgoingPayment` is made against their wallet.

For details on how to facilitate an interactive grant refer to the <LinkOut href='https://openpayments.dev/guides/create-interactive-grant/'>

  chunk='4'
/>

### 8. Create an initial Outgoing Payment

Create an `outgoingPayment` on the sender wallet's resource server using the access token returned by the authorization server in the grant request.

Add the following properties:

- `walletAddress` : the URL of the sender's wallet address.
- `quoteId` : the URL of the quote specifying the payment amount.

<ChunkedSnippet
  source='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/interledger/open-payments-snippets/main/outgoing-payment/outgoing-payment-create.ts'
  chunk='3'
/>

### 9. Rotate the Access Token

:::note
This step is only required if the access token you obtained in the previous `outgoingPayment` grant request has expired.
:::

Rotate the access token obtained from the previous `outgoingPayment` grant request.

<ChunkedSnippet

  chunk='3'
/>

### 10. Create another Outgoing Payment

Create another `outgoingPayment` on the sender wallet's resource server using the new access token returned by the authorization server in the previous step.

Add the following properties:

- `walletAddress` : the URL of the sender's wallet address.
- `quoteId` : the URL of the quote specifying the payment amount.

<ChunkedSnippet
  source='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/interledger/open-payments-snippets/main/outgoing-payment/outgoing-payment-create.ts'
  chunk='3'
/>

### 11. Make recurring Outgoing Payments

Repeat steps 9 and 10 to facilitate as many payments as needed by your application.
