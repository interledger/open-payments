:::tip[Summary]
Learn how to get an outgoing payment grant for future payments without specifying any recipients.
:::

Often, a transaction will start with the client getting the recipient’s details and asking the recipient’s ASE for permission to send money. However, Open Payments also supports a different approach, where the client gets permission from the sender’s ASE to send money before knowing who the recipient will be. Web Monetization's pay-as-you-browse model uses this approach.

In this model, a user installs a browser extension and visits a web monetized site. The extension uses Open Payments to issue continuous outgoing payments to the site, on behalf of the user, for as long as the user is on the site. The extension has no idea who the recipient will be until the user visits the site.

Setting up the extension requires the user to connect it to their wallet account. They specify a maximum amount they're willing to spend and select whether the amount should renew monthly. The extension then receives an outgoing payment grant from the user’s wallet provider, allowing the extension to initiate future payments.

In this guide, you’ll assume the role of an app developer. The guide takes you through the steps your app will perform to receive an outgoing payment grant with a specified debit amount but no known recipients. The example scenario illustrates how to allow your app’s user to send payments of up to $100 CAD a month for three months.

## Steps

### 1. Get wallet address information

Let’s assume your user saved their wallet address in their account profile when setting up your app. Call the [Get Wallet Address API](/apis/wallet-address-server/operations/get-wallet-address) to get required details about your user's wallet account.

<Tabs syncKey="lang">
<TabItem label='TypeScript/JavaScript' icon='seti:javascript'>
  ```ts
  const userWalletAddress = await client.walletAddress.get({
    url: 'https://cloudninebank.example.com/user'
  })
  ```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### 2. Request an interactive outgoing payment grant

Use the authorization server information received in the previous step to call the [Grant Request API](/apis/auth-server/operations/post-request). The purpose of this call is to obtain a token that allows your client to request outgoing payment resources be created on your user's wallet account.

<InteractionReq />

In addition to any required parameters, include the following in the request:

- `limits` object
  - `debitAmount` - The maximum amount that your user can send per interval. When the next interval begins, the value resets.
  - `interval` - The [time interval](#about-the-interval) under which the grant is valid.

Your user indicates they want to make payments of up to $100 CAD a month for three months. The amount resets each month and any unspent portions don't roll over.

<Tabs syncKey="lang">
<TabItem label='TypeScript/JavaScript' icon='seti:javascript'>
  ```ts
  const grant = await client.grant.request(
    {
      url: userWalletAddress.authServer,
    },
    {
      access_token: {
        access: [
          {
            identifier: userWalletAddress.id,
            type: 'outgoing-payment',
            actions: ['read', 'create'],
            limits: {
              interval: 'R3/2025-05-20T13:00:00Z/P1M'
              debitAmount: {
                assetCode: 'CAD',
                assetScale: 2,
                value: '10000',
              },
            },
          },
        ],
      },
      client: userWalletAddress.id,
      interact: {
        start: ['redirect'],
        finish: {
          method: 'redirect',
          uri: 'https://cloudninebank.example.com/finish/T8jw5Xy',
          nonce: NONCE,
        },
      },
    },
  );
  ```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

#### About the interval

The interval used in this guide is `R3/2025-05-20T13:00:00Z/P1M`. Remember that your user wants to send payments up to $100 CAD a month for three months. The interval breaks down like this:

- `R[3]/` is the number of repetitions - three.
- `2025-05-20` is the start date of the repeating interval - 20 May 2025
- `T13:00:00Z/` is the start time of the repeating interval - 1:00 PM UTC.
- `[P1M]` is the period between each interval - one month. Used with `R[3]`, you have a grant that’s valid once a month for three months.

Altogether, your user can send up to $100 CAD from:

- 1 PM UTC on 20 May 2025 through 12:59 PM UCT on 20 June 2025
- 1 PM UTC on 20 June 2025 through 12:59 PM UTC on 20 July 2025
- 1 PM UTC on 20 July 2025 through 12:59 PM UCT on 20 August 2025

### 3. Start interaction with your user

<StartInteraction />

### 4. Finish interaction with your user

<FinishInteraction />

### 5. Request a grant continuation

In this guide, we’re assuming the IdP has a user interface with which your user interacts. When the interaction completes, your user is directed back to your app. Now the client can make a grant continuation request.

:::note
In a scenario where a user interface isn't available, consider implementing a polling mechanism to check for the completion of the interaction.
:::

Add the `interact_ref` returned in the redirect URI's query parameters.

<Tabs syncKey='lang'>
  <TabItem label='TypeScript/JavaScript' icon='seti:javascript'>
  ```ts wrap
  const grant = await client.grant.continue(
    {
      accessToken: CONTINUE_ACCESS_TOKEN,
      url: CONTINUE_URI,
    },
    {
      interact_ref: INTERACT_REF,
    },
  );
  ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

A successful response provides your app with an access token. Now your app can issue outgoing payment requests to future recipients against the grant. Each request must reference the access token.
