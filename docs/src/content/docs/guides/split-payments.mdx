:::tip[Summary]
Learn how to take a single payment and split the value between multiple recipients.
:::

Imagine making a purchase from an online marketplace. From your perspective, youâ€™re sending a single payment to a merchant in exchange for a good. Behind the scenes, the marketplace receives a portion of the payment as a service fee.

There's a few ways for the marketplace to collect their fee. For example, it could receive the full amount, deduct the fee, then send the rest to the merchant. However, holding funds for the merchant, even for a second, requires compliance with certain financial rules and regulations. A better way is to ensure both parties only receive the amount they're supposed to receive, directly from the user.

Remember, Open Payments doesn't execute payments or touch money in any way. It's used to issue payment instructions before any money movement occurs. Examples of payment instructions are, "of the $6 purchase, pay the marketplace $1 and the merchant $5." This way, funds meant for one party never pass through the other party.

For this guide, you'll assume the role of a platform operator of an online marketplace. The guide explains how to split a customer's $100 USD payment into two incoming payments. The merchant will receive 99% of the payment while you keep 1% as a fee.

The three parties involved in the transaction are the:

- Customer: the purchaser of a good or service on the marketplace
- Merchant: the seller of a good or service on the marketplace
- Platform operator: you, as the operator of the marketplace

## Steps

### 1. Get wallet address information

When a customer initiates a payment, your platform must get wallet address information for the customer, the merchant, and you, as the operator.

Let's assume your wallet address already saved to your platform, as is the merchant's. Let's also assume the customer provided their wallet address at the beginning of the checkout flow.

Call the [Get Wallet Address API](/apis/wallet-address-server/operations/get-wallet-address) for each address.

<Tabs syncKey="lang">
<TabItem label='TypeScript/JavaScript' icon='seti:javascript'>
  ```ts
  const customerWalletAddress = await client.walletAddress.get({
    url: 'https://cloudninebank.example.com/customer'
  })

  const merchantWalletAddress = await client.walletAddress.get({
  url: 'https://happylifebank.example.com/merchant'
  })

  const platformWalletAddress = await client.walletAddress.get({
  url: 'https://coolwallet.example.com/platform'
  })
  ```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### 2. Request incoming payment grants

Use the merchant and platform `authServer` details, received in the previous step, to call the [Grant Request API](/apis/auth-server/operations/post-request).

The purpose of these calls is to obtain access tokens that allow your platform to request an incoming payment resource be created on the merchant's wallet account and your wallet account.

:::note[Alternate scenario]
If you and the merchant use the same account servicing entity, and the authorization server information received is the same for you both, you only need one `incomingPayment` grant.
:::

<Tabs syncKey="lang">
<TabItem label='Merchant' icon='seti:javascript'>
  ```ts wrap
  const merchantIncomingPaymentGrant = await client.grant.request(
    {
      url: merchantWalletAddress.authServer
    },
    {
      access_token: {
        access: [
          {
            type: "incoming-payment",
            actions: ["read", "create"],
          },
        ],
      },
    },
  );
  ```
</TabItem>
<TabItem label='Platform' icon='seti:javascript'>
  ```ts wrap
  const platformIncomingPaymentGrant = await client.grant.request(
    {
      url: platformWalletAddress.authServer
    },
    {
      access_token: {
        access: [
          {
            type: "incoming-payment",
            actions: ["read", "create"],
          },
        ],
      },
    },
  );
  ```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### 3. Request the creation of incoming payment resources

Use the access tokens returned in the previous responses to call the [Create Incoming Payment API](/apis/resource-server/operations/create-incoming-payment).

The purpose of these calls is to request an incoming payment resource be created on the merchant's wallet account and your wallet account.

Remember that you're retaining 1% of the customer's $100 USD payment as a fee.

Include the following in both requests, along with any other required parameters.

- `incomingAmount` object
  - `value` - The maximum amount to pay into a given wallet address.
  - `assetCode` - The code used by the wallet account, provided in the Get Wallet Address API's response.
  - `assetScale` - The scale used by the wallet account, provided in the Get Wallet Address API's response.

The full `value` of $100 is `10000`. The merchant will receive 99% (`9900`) and you will receive 1% (`100`).

<Tabs syncKey="lang">
<TabItem label='Merchant' icon='seti:javascript'>
  ```ts wrap
  const merchantIncomingPayment = await client.incomingPayment.create(
    {
      url: merchantWalletAddress.resourceServer,
      accessToken: merchantIncomingPaymentGrant.access_token.value
    },
    {
      walletAddress: merchantWalletAddress.id,
      incomingAmount: {
        value: '9900',
        assetCode: 'USD',
        assetScale: 2
      },
    },
  )
  ```
</TabItem>
<TabItem label='Platform' icon='seti:javascript'>
  ```ts wrap
  const platformIncomingPayment = await client.incomingPayment.create(
    {
      url: platformWalletAddress.resourceServer,
      accessToken: platformIncomingPaymentGrant.access_token.value
    },
    {
      walletAddress: platformWalletAddress.id,
      incomingAmount: {
        value: '100',
        assetCode: 'USD',
        assetScale: 2
      },
    },
  )
  ```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### 4. Request a quote grant

Use the customer's `authServer` details, received in Step 1, to call the [Grant Request API](/apis/auth-server/operations/post-request).

The purpose of this call is to obtain an access token that allows your platform to request quote resources be created on the customer's wallet account.

<Tabs syncKey="lang">
<TabItem label='TypeScript/JavaScript' icon='seti:javascript'>
  ```ts wrap
  const customerQuoteGrant = await client.grant.request(
    {
      url: customerWalletAddress.authServer
    },
    {
      access_token: {
        access: [
          {
            type: 'quote',
            actions: ['create', 'read']
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  )
  ```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### 5. Request the creation of quote resources

Use the access token, received in the previous step, to call the [Create Quote API](/apis/resource-server/operations/create-quote).

The purpose of this call is to request a quote resource be created on the customer's wallet account. Since the customer needs a quote resource for the merchant and the platform, we'll call the API twice using the same access token.

First, let's request a quote resource associated with the merchant. The request must contain the `receiver`, which is the merchant's incoming payment `id`, along with any other required parameters. The `id` was returned in the Create an Incoming Payment API response in Step 3.

Next, call the Create Quote API again and request a quote resource associated with the platform's incoming payment `id`.

<Tabs syncKey="lang">
<TabItem label='Merchant' icon='seti:javascript'>
  ```ts wrap
  const merchantQuote = await client.quote.create(
    {
      url: customerWalletAddress.resourceServer,
      accessToken: customerQuoteGrant.access_token.value
    },
    {
      method: 'ilp',
      walletAddress: customerWalletAddress.id,
      receiver: merchantIncomingPayment.id
    }
  )
  ```
</TabItem>
<TabItem label='Platform' icon='seti:javascript'>
  ```ts wrap
  const platformQuote = await client.quote.create(
    {
      url: customerWalletAddress.resourceServer,
      accessToken: customerQuoteGrant.access_token.value
    },
    {
      method: 'ilp',
      walletAddress: customerWalletAddress.id,
      receiver: platformIncomingPayment.id
    }
  )
  ```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Each response returns a `receiveAmount`, a `debitAmount`, and other required information.

- `receiveAmount` - The `incomingAmount` value from the incoming payment resource
- `debitAmount` - The amount the customer must pay toward the incoming payment resource (`receiveAmount` plus any applicable fees)

### 6. Request an interactive outgoing payment grant

Use the customer's `authServer` information received in Step 1 to call the [Grant Request API](/apis/auth-server/operations/post-request).

The purpose of this call is to obtain an access token that allows your platform to request outgoing payment resources be created on the customer's wallet account.

<InteractionReq />

Include the following in the request, along with any other required parameters.

- `limits` object
  - `receiveAmount` object
    - `value` - The total amount the customer has agreed to pay.
    - `assetCode` - The code used by the wallet account, provided in the Get Wallet Address APIâ€™s response.
    - `assetScale` - The scale used by the wallet account, provided in the Get Wallet Address APIâ€™s response.

<Tabs syncKey="lang">
<TabItem label='TypeScript/JavaScript' icon='seti:javascript'>
  ```ts wrap
  const pendingCustomerOutgoingPaymentGrant = await client.grant.request(
    {
      url: customerWalletAddress.authServer
    },
    {
      access_token: {
        access: [
          {
            identifier: customerWalletAddress.id,
            type: 'outgoing-payment',
            actions: ['read', 'create'],
            limits: {
              receiveAmount: {
                assetCode: 'USD',
                assetScale: 2,
                value: '10000'
              }
            }
          }
        ]
      },
      interact: {
        start: ['redirect'],
        finish: {
          method: 'redirect',
          uri: 'http://localhost:3344',
          nonce: NONCE
        }
      }
    }
  )
  ```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### 7. Start interaction with the customer

<StartInteraction />

### 8. Finish interaction with the customer

<FinishInteraction />

### 9. Request a grant continuation

In our example, we're assuming the IdP the customer interacted with has a user interface. When the interaction completes, the customer returns to your platform. Now your platform can make a continuation request for the outgoing payment grant.

:::note
In a scenario where a user interface isn't available, consider implementing a polling mechanism to check for the completion of the interaction.
:::

Call the [Grant Continuation Request API](/apis/auth-server/operations/post-continue). The purpose of this call is to request an access token that allows your platform to request outgoing payment resources be created on the customer's wallet account.

Issue the request to the `continue uri` provided in the initial outgoing payment grant response (Step 6). For example:

`POST https://auth.interledger-test.dev/continue/4CF492MLVMSW9MKMXKHQ`

Include the `interact_ref` returned in the redirect URI's query parameters.

<Tabs syncKey="lang">
<TabItem label='TypeScript/JavaScript' icon='seti:javascript'>
  ```ts wrap
  const customerOutgoingPaymentGrant = await client.grant.continue(
    {
      url: pendingCustomerOutgoingPaymentGrant.continue.uri,
      accessToken: pendingCustomerOutgoingPaymentGrant.continue.access_token.value
    },
    {
      interact_ref: interactRef
    }
  )
  ```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### 10. Request the creation of outgoing payment resources

Recall that the Create Quote API responses for the merchant and your platform (Step 5) both included a `debitAmount` and a `receiveAmount`. The responses also included an `id` which is a URL to identify each quote.

Because the quotes contain debit and receive amounts, we won't specify any other amounts when making a Create Outgoing Payment API request. Instead, we will specify a `quoteId`.

Use the access tokens returned in Step 5 to call the [Create Outgoing Payment API](/apis/resource-server/operations/create-outgoing-payment).

The purpose of these calls is to request an outgoing payment resource be created on the customer's wallet account: one for the merchant and one for your platform. Include the appropriate `quoteId` in each request.
