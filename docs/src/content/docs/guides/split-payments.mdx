:::tip[Summary]
Add support for split payments to your client. A split payment is a single payment of a full amount that's split into one or more simultaneous transactions and delivered to multiple recipients.
:::

In the context of Open Payments, a split payment is a single payment that's divided into two or more smaller payments before reaching the recipients. From the sender's point of view, they're making a single payment to a single recipient.

In this guide you will assume the role of a platform operator adding support for split payments to your online marketplace. When a consumer makes a purchase on your marketplace, both you and the merchant will receive a portion of the payment.

The three parties involved in the transaction are the:

- Customer: the purchaser of a good or service on the marketplace
- Merchant: the seller of a good or service on the marketplace
- Platform: you, as the operator of the marketplace

## Steps

### 1. Get wallet address information

For the customer to initiate a payment, your website must get wallet address information for the customer, the merchant, and your marketplace platform. Let's assume that your wallet address is built in to your platform and the merchant saved their wallet address in their marketplace account. Let's also assume the customer provided their wallet address during the checkout flow.

In this example, we assume each party has an Open Payments-enabled account with a different account servicing entity.

```ts wrap
const customerWalletAddress = await client.walletAddress.get({
  url: 'https://cloudninebank.example.com/customer'
})

const merchantWalletAddress = await client.walletAddress.get({
  url: 'https://happylifebank.example.com/merchant'
})

const platformWalletAddress = await client.walletAddress.get({
  url: 'https://coolwallet.example.com/platform'
})
```

### 2. Request Incoming Payment grants

Using the authorization server information received from the previous step, request two `incomingPayment` grants: one from the merchant wallet authorization server and one from your platform wallet authorization server. The grants will allow an `incomingPayment` resource to be created on both your and your merchant's Open Payments accounts.

:::note[Alternate scenario]
If you and the merchant use the same account servicing entity, and the authorization server information received is the same for you both, you only need one `incomingPayment` grant.
:::

<Tabs>
<TabItem label = 'Merchant'>
```ts wrap
const merchantIncomingPaymentGrant = await client.grant.request(
  {
    url: merchantWalletAddress.authServer
  },
  {
    access_token: {
      access: [
        {
          type: "incoming-payment",
          actions: ["read", "create"],
        },
      ],
    },
  },
);
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem label = 'Platform'>
```ts wrap
const platformIncomingPaymentGrant = await client.grant.request(
  {
    url: platformWalletAddress.authServer
  },
  {
    access_token: {
      access: [
        {
          type: "incoming-payment",
          actions: ["read", "create"],
        },
      ],
    },
  },
);
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### 3. Create Incoming Payments

Using the access tokens provided by the authorization servers in the previous step, request the creation of two `incomingPayment` resources: one on the merchant's wallet account and one on your platform wallet account.

In this example, you will give the merchant 99% of the payment while retaining 1% as a platform operation fee.

<Tabs>
<TabItem label = 'Merchant'>

```ts wrap
const merchantIncomingPayment = await client.incomingPayment.create(
  {
    url: merchantWalletAddress.resourceServer,
    accessToken: merchantIncomingPaymentGrant.access_token.value
  },
  {
    walletAddress: merchantWalletAddress.id,
    incomingAmount: {
      value: '9900',
      assetCode: 'USD',
      assetScale: 2
    },
    expiresAt: new Date(Date.now() + 60_000 * 10).toISOString()
  }
)
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem label = 'Platform'>

```ts wrap
const platformIncomingPayment = await client.incomingPayment.create(
  {
    url: platformWalletAddress.resourceServer,
    accessToken: platformIncomingPaymentGrant.access_token.value
  },
  {
    walletAddress: platformWalletAddress.id,
    incomingAmount: {
      value: '100',
      assetCode: 'USD',
      assetScale: 2
    },
    expiresAt: new Date(Date.now() + 60_000 * 10).toISOString()
  }
)
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### 4. Request a Quote grant

Request a `quote` grant from the customer wallet authorization server. You received the authorization server URL as part of Step 1.

```ts wrap
const customerQuoteGrant = await client.grant.request(
  {
    url: customerWalletAddress.authServer
  },
  {
    access_token: {
      access: [
        {
          type: 'quote',
          actions: ['create', 'read']
        }
      ]
    }
  }
)
```

### 5. Create Quotes

Using the customer-side access token received from the previous step, request the creation of two `quote` resources: one on the merchant wallet account and one on your platform wallet account.

<Tabs>
<TabItem label = 'Merchant'>
```ts wrap
const merchantQuote = await client.quote.create(
  {
    url: customerWalletAddress.resourceServer,
    accessToken: customerQuoteGrant.access_token.value
  },
  {
    method: 'ilp',
    walletAddress: customerWalletAddress.id,
    receiver: merchantIncomingPayment.id
  }
)
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem label = 'Platform'>
```ts wrap
const platformQuote = await client.quote.create(
  {
    url: customerWalletAddress.resourceServer,
    accessToken: customerQuoteGrant.access_token.value
  },
  {
    method: 'ilp',
    walletAddress: customerWalletAddress.id,
    receiver: platformIncomingPayment.id
  }
)
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### 6. Request an interactive Outgoing Payment grant for the customer

Request an interactive `outgoingPayment` grant from the customer wallet authorization server.

<InteractionReq />

Include the `receiveAmount` object within the `limits` object. The `value` property must be the total amount the customer has agreed to pay.

```ts wrap
const pendingCustomerOutgoingPaymentGrant = await client.grant.request(
  {
    url: customerWalletAddress.authServer
  },
  {
    access_token: {
      access: [
        {
          identifier: customerWalletAddress.id,
          type: 'outgoing-payment',
          actions: ['read', 'create'],
          limits: {
            receiveAmount: {
              assetCode: 'USD',
              assetScale: 2,
              value: '10000'
            }
          }
        }
      ]
    },
    interact: {
      start: ['redirect'],
      finish: {
        method: 'redirect',
        uri: 'http://localhost:3344',
        nonce: NONCE
      }
    }
  }
)
```

### 7. Start interaction with the user

<StartInteraction />

### 8. Finish interaction with the user

<FinishInteraction />

You'll need the interaction reference (`interact_ref`) in the next step.

### 9. Request a grant continuation

In this guide, we're assuming the IdP has a user interface with which the customer interacts. When the interaction completes, the customer should be directed back to your platform. Now you can make the grant continuation request.

:::note
In a scenario where a user interface is not available, consider implementing a polling mechanism to check for the completion of the interaction.
:::

Add the `interact_ref` returned by the client wallet authorization server in the previous step.

```ts wrap
const customerOutgoingPaymentGrant = await client.grant.continue(
  {
    url: pendingCustomerOutgoingPaymentGrant.continue.uri,
    accessToken: pendingCustomerOutgoingPaymentGrant.continue.access_token.value
  },
  {
    interact_ref: interactRef
  }
)
```

Issue the request to the `continue uri` supplied in the authorization serverâ€™s initial grant response (Step 6). For example:

`POST https://auth.interledger-test.dev/continue/4CF492MLVMSW9MKMXKHQ`

A successful continuation response from the authorization server provides your client with an access token and other information necessary to continue the transaction.

```json title="Example response" wrap
{
  "access_token": {
    "value": "OS9M2PMHKUR64TB8N6BW7OZB8CDFONP219RP1LT0",
    "manage": "https://auth.interledger-test.dev/token/dd17a202-9982-4ed9-ae31-564947fb6379",
    "expires_in": 3600,
    "access": [
      {
        "type": "outgoing-payment",
        "actions": ["create", "read"],
        "identifier": "customerWalletAddress.id",
        "limits": {
          "receiver": "INCOMING_PAYMENT_URL",
          "debitAmount": {
            "value": "10000",
            "assetCode": "USD",
            "assetScale": 2
          }
        }
      }
    ]
  },
  "continue": {
    "access_token": {
      "value": "33OMUKMKSKU80UPRY5NM"
    },
    "uri": "https://auth.interledger-test.dev/continue/4CF492MLVMSW9MKMXKHQ",
    "wait": 30
  }
}
```

### 10. Create outgoing payments

Using the merchant and platform access tokens provided in the quote responses in Step 5, request the creation of two `outgoingPayment` resources on the customer's wallet account: one for the merchant and one for your platform.

The `quoteId` is the URL of the quote that specified the amount to be paid to the merchant and the platform, respectively.

    walletAddress: customerWalletAddress.id,
    quoteId: merchantQuote.id
  }
)
```

  }
)
