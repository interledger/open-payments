:::tip[Summary]
Learn how to send recurring remittance payments where the recipient will receive a fixed amount with each payment.
:::

A remittance payment is a transfer of money from one person to another, typically across borders or long distances, often involving currency conversion and fees. In this guide, you will learn how to set up a recurring payment from a sender in which the recipient receives a fixed amount.

This approach is particularly useful for remittance app scenarios where:

- The sender and the recipient each transact in different currencies
- The sender wants the recipient to receive a fixed amount, denominated in the recipient's local currency, on a recurring basis
- The sender is willing to cover any differences in the exchange rate

## Scenario

Imagine someone in the US wants to send money to a family member in Mexico. They want their family member to receive an exact amount in Mexican pesos (MXN) each month.

For this guide, you'll assume the role of a developer building a remittance app. This guide explains how to set up a recurring payment in US dollars, where the recipient will receive exactly $4,000 MXN each month for three months.

The amount debited from the sender's payment account can vary each month depending on changes to the exchange rate. For simplicity, this guide assumes a static exchange rate of \$1 USD for every $20 MXN.

**Example transaction details:**

- **Recipient receives**: $4,000 MXN each month for three months
- **Exchange rate**: A static rate of \$1 USD for every \$20 MXN
- **Sender pays**: $200 USD each month

The three parties involved in this scenario are the:

- **Developer**: you, the person building the remittance app
- **Sender**: the person using your app to send money in USD
- **Recipient**: the person receiving the money in MXN

## Steps

### 1. Get wallet address information

When the sender initiates a payment through your app, you must get wallet address information for both the sender and the recipient.

Let's assume the sender saved their wallet address to their profile settings in your app. Let's also assume the sender entered the recipient's wallet address into your app's payment form.

Call the <Badge text="GET" variant="note" /> [Get Wallet Address API](/apis/wallet-address-server/operations/get-wallet-address) for each address.

  ```ts wrap
  const senderWalletAddress = await client.walletAddress.get({
    url: 'https://cloudninebank.example.com/sender'
  })
  const recipientWalletAddress = await client.walletAddress.get({

  })
```

  "assetScale": 2,
  "authServer": "https://auth.happylifebank.example.com/",
  "resourceServer": "https://happylifebank.example.com/op"
}
```

</details>

### 2. Request an interactive outgoing payment grant

Use the sender's `authServer` information received in the previous step to call the <Badge text="POST" variant="success" /> [Grant Request API](/apis/auth-server/operations/post-request).

This call obtains an access token that allows your app to request outgoing payment resources be created on the sender's wallet account.

Because the sender wants the recipient to receive a fixed amount of $4,000 MXN each month, the request must have a `limits` object containing a `receiveAmount` and an `interval`.

- `receiveAmount` - The maximum amount that the recipient can receive per interval. When the next interval begins, the value resets.
- `interval` - The [time interval](#about-the-interval) under which the grant is valid.

:::note
Outgoing payments require an interactive grant, which the sender approves once. While the grant (and its access token) is valid and within its limits (`interval` + `receiveAmount`), your app can create outgoing payments without re-approval each interval. You can find more information in the [Open Payments flow](/concepts/op-flow/#outgoing-payment) and [identity providers](/identity/idp) pages.

#### About the interval

The interval used in this guide is `R3/2025-10-03T23:25:00Z/P1M`. Remember that the sender wants the recipient to receive $4,000 MXN a month for three months. The interval breaks down like this:

- `R3/` is the number of repetitions - three
- `2025-10-03` is the start date of the repeating interval - 03 October 2025
- `T23:25:00Z/` is the start time of the repeating interval - 11:25 PM UTC
- `P1M` is the period between each interval - one month. Used with `R3`, you have a grant that's valid once a month for three months.

Altogether, this grant will allow the sender to make outgoing payments from:

- 11:25 PM UTC on 03 October 2025 through 11:24 PM UTC on 03 November 2025
- 11:25 PM UTC on 03 November 2025 through 11:24 PM UTC on 03 December 2025
- 11:25 PM UTC on 03 December 2025 through 11:24 PM UTC on 03 January 2026

### 3. Start interaction with the sender

<Start />

### 4. Finish interaction with the sender

<Finish />

### 5. Request a grant continuation

In our example, we're assuming the IdP your user (the sender) interacted with has a user interface. When the interaction completes, your user returns to your app. Now your app can make a continuation request for the outgoing payment grant.

:::note
In a scenario where a user interface isn't available, consider implementing a polling mechanism to check for the completion of the interaction.
:::

Call the <Badge text="POST" variant="success" /> [Grant Continuation Request API](/apis/auth-server/operations/post-continue/). This call obtains an access token that allows your app to continue the outgoing payment grant request.

Issue the request to the `continue.uri` provided in the initial outgoing payment grant response.

Include the `interact_ref` returned in the redirect URI's query parameters.

### 6. Request an incoming payment grant

Use the recipient's `authServer` details, received in Step 1, to call the <Badge text="POST" variant="success" /> [Grant Request API](/apis/auth-server/operations/post-request/).

This call obtains an access token that allows your app to request an incoming payment resource be created on the recipient's wallet account.

<Tabs syncKey="lang">
  <TabItem label='TypeScript/JavaScript' icon='seti:javascript'>
  ```ts wrap
  const recipientIncomingPaymentGrant = await client.grant.request(

}
```
</details>

### 7. Request the creation of an incoming payment resource

Use the access token returned in the previous response to call the <Badge text="POST" variant="success" /> [Create Incoming Payment API](/apis/resource-server/operations/create-incoming-payment).

This call requests an incoming payment resource be created on the recipient's wallet account.

<Tabs syncKey="lang">
  <TabItem label='TypeScript/JavaScript' icon='seti:javascript'>
  ```ts wrap
  const recipientIncomingPayment = await client.incomingPayment.create(
    {
      url: recipientWalletAddress.resourceServer,

      "ilpAddress": "...",
      "sharedSecret": "..."
    }
  ]
}
```
</details>

### 8. Request a quote grant

Use the sender's `authServer` details, received in Step 1, to call the <Badge text="POST" variant="success" /> [Grant Request API](/apis/auth-server/operations/post-request).

This call obtains an access token that allows your app to request a quote resource be created on the sender's wallet.

<Tabs syncKey="lang">
  <TabItem label='TypeScript/JavaScript' icon='seti:javascript'>
  ```ts wrap
  const senderQuoteGrant = await client.grant.request(
    {
      url: senderWalletAddress.authServer
    },
    {
      access_token: {
        access: [
          {
            type: 'quote',
            actions: ['create']
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  )
  ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

<details>
<summary>Example response</summary>
The following shows an example response from the sender's wallet provider.
```json wrap
{
  "access_token": {
    "value": "...", // access token value for quote grant
    "manage": "https://auth.cloudninebank.example.com/token/{...}", // management uri for access token
    "access": [
      {
        "type": "quote",
        "actions": ["create"]
      }
    ]
  },
  "continue": {
    "access_token": {
      "value": "..." // access token for continuing the request
    },
  "uri": "https://auth.cloudninebank.example.com/continue/{...}" // continuation request uri
  }
}
```
</details>

### 9. Request the creation of a quote resource

Use the access token received in the previous step to call the <Badge text="POST" variant="success" /> [Create Quote API](/apis/resource-server/operations/create-quote).

This call requests that a quote resource be created on the sender's wallet account. The request must contain the `receiver`, which is the recipient's incoming payment `id`, along with the `receiveAmount`, which is the exact amount the sender wants the recipient to receive.

The `receiveAmount` specifies that the recipient will receive exactly $4,000 MXN.

<Tabs syncKey="lang">
  <TabItem label='TypeScript/JavaScript' icon='seti:javascript'>
  ```ts wrap
  const senderQuote = await client.quote.create(
    {
      url: senderWalletAddress.resourceServer,
      accessToken: senderQuoteGrant.access_token.value
    },
    {
      method: 'ilp',
      walletAddress: senderWalletAddress.id,
      receiver: recipientIncomingPayment.id,
      receiveAmount: {
        value: '400000',
        assetCode: 'MXN',
        assetScale: 2
      }
    }
  )
  ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

The response returns a `receiveAmount`, a `debitAmount`, and other required information.

- `debitAmount` - The amount the sender must pay (in USD in our example) after currency conversion.
- `receiveAmount` - The amount the recipient will actually receive (exactly $4,000 MXN in our example).

:::note[Expiring quotes]
Quote responses include an `expiresAt` timestamp. Create the outgoing payment before the quote expires. If creation fails because the quote expired, request a new quote and try again.

</details>

### 10. Request the creation of an outgoing payment resource

Use the access token returned in the outgoing payment grant continuation response (Step 5) to call the <Badge text="POST" variant="success" /> [Create Outgoing Payment API](/apis/resource-server/operations/create-outgoing-payment/).

<Tabs syncKey="lang">
  <TabItem label='TypeScript/JavaScript' icon='seti:javascript'>
  ```ts wrap
  const senderOutgoingPayment = await client.outgoingPayment.create(
    {
      url: senderWalletAddress.resourceServer,
      accessToken: senderOutgoingPaymentGrant.access_token.value
    },
    {
      walletAddress: senderWalletAddress.id,
      quoteId: senderQuote.id,
    }
  )
  ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

<details>
<summary>Example response</summary>
The following shows an example response from the sender's wallet provider.
```json wrap
{
  "id": "https://cloudninebank.example.com/outgoing-payments/{...}", // url of the outgoing payment
  "walletAddress": "https://cloudninebank.example.com/sender",
  "receiver": "https://happylifebank.example.com/incoming-payments/{...}", // url of the incoming payment being paid
  "debitAmount": {
    "value": "20000", // The amount to debit from the sender's account
    "assetCode": "USD",
    "assetScale": 2
  },
  "receiveAmount": {
    "value": "400000", // Recipient to receive $4,000 MXN
    "assetCode": "MXN",
    "assetScale": 2

    "assetCode": "USD",
    "assetScale": 2
  },
  "createdAt": "2025-10-03T23:29:03.41Z"
}
```
</details>

The first payment is now set up. At the next interval (one month from now), repeat the following steps to request the creation of:

1. An incoming payment resource ([step 7](#7-request-the-creation-of-an-incoming-payment-resource))
2. A quote resource ([step 9](#9-request-the-creation-of-a-quote-resource))
3. An outgoing payment resource ([step 10](#10-request-the-creation-of-an-outgoing-payment-resource))

Use the access token associated with each resource's grant in the requests. You don't need to request new grants because the original grants should still be valid.

:::note[Access token expiry]
If a grant's access token has expired, call the <Badge text="POST" variant="success" /> [Rotate Access Token API](/apis/auth-server/operations/post-token/), then use the new token in the appropriate request.
