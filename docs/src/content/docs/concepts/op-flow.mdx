:::tip[Summary]
When a client issues payment instructions, numerous interactions between the client and servers are needed to obtain grants, verify identities, and create the resources required to complete a transaction.
:::

This page provides a high-level look at the API calls and interactions that occur between the client and servers during a payment. The sequence diagrams are for illustrative purposes and may be simplified in some instances.

### Assumptions

- The <Tooltip content="Such as a mobile or web application or service" client:load>client's</Tooltip> user is the sender.
- The client already has the sender's Open Payments-enabled account details and is able to send payments on their behalf.

## Get account details

A client retrieves public details about a recipient's Open Payments-enabled account by issuing a <LinkOut href='/apis/wallet-address-server/operations/get-wallet-address/'>GET request</LinkOut> to the recipient's wallet address. Details include the asset code and scale of the underlying account, as well as the authorization and resource server URLs which the client needs in order to set up a payment to the recipient.

    participant C as Client
    participant WA as Wallet address

    C->>WA: GET wallet address URL (e.g. https://wallet.example.com/alice)
    WA-->>C: 200 wallet address found, return public account details

`}
/>

</MermaidWrapper>

## Incoming payment

The client first <LinkOut href='/apis/auth-server/operations/post-request'>requests/receives a grant</LinkOut> from the authorization server of the recipient's <Tooltip content="account servicing entity" client:load>ASE</Tooltip> to create an `incoming-payment` resource. The client then sends a request to the ASE's resource server to <LinkOut href='/apis/resource-server/operations/create-incoming-payment/'>create the resource</LinkOut>. When created, the resource server returns unique payment details the client will use to address one or more payments to the recipient.

    participant C as Client
    participant AS as Authorization server<br/>recipient's ASE
    participant RS as Resource server<br/>recipient's ASE

    C->>AS: POST grant request with type=incoming-payment
    AS-->>C: 200 OK, returns access token
    C->>RS: POST create incoming payment
    RS-->>C: 201 incoming payment created, return incoming payment with public details

`}
/>

</MermaidWrapper>

## Quote

The client <LinkOut href='/apis/auth-server/operations/post-request'>requests/receives a grant</LinkOut> from the authorization server of the sender's <Tooltip content="Account servicing entity" client: load><span>ASE</span></Tooltip> to create a `quote` resource. The client then sends a request to the resource server to <LinkOut href='/apis/resource-server/operations/create-quote'>create the resource</LinkOut>. When created, the resource server returns, among other things, a quote `id` and the amount it will cost to make the payment.

<MermaidWrapper client:load>

    participant C as Client
    participant AS as Authorization server<br/>sender's ASE
    participant RS as Resource server<br/>sender's ASE

    C->>AS: POST grant request with type=quote
    AS-->>C: 200 OK, returns access token
    C->>RS: POST create quote
    RS-->>C: 201 quote created, returns quote details

`}
/>

</MermaidWrapper>

## Outgoing payment

Before an outgoing payment resource can be created on the sender's account, Open Payments requires the client to send an <LinkOut href='/apis/auth-server/operations/post-request'>interactive grant request</LinkOut> to the authorization server of the sender's <Tooltip content="Account servicing entity" client: load><span>ASE</span></Tooltip>.

An interactive grant requires explicit consent be collected from the sender before an access token is issued. While the client must facilitate the interaction, the authorization server and identity provider (IdP) of the sender's ASE are responsible for the interface and collecting consent.

After consent is obtained, the client requests permission to <LinkOut href='/apis/auth-server/operations/post-continue'>continue the grant request</LinkOut> in order to obtain an access token.

:::note[Continue request timing]
For outgoing payments, explicit user consent is required before proceeding with the continuation request. After the user completes their interaction with the identity provider (IdP), they should be redirected back to your application. At this point, you can make the grant continuation request. In scenarios where a user interface is not available, consider implementing a polling mechanism to check for the completion of the interaction.
:::

<Interactive />

Once an access token is acquired, the client can request the creation of the <LinkOut href='/apis/resource-server/operations/create-outgoing-payment'>outgoing-payment resource</LinkOut>. The setup of the payment is complete and the Open Payments flow ends after the resource is created.

    participant C as Client
    participant RS as Resource server<br/>sender's ASE

    C->>RS: POST create outgoing payment
    RS-->>C: 201 outgoing payment created, <br/>returns outgoing payment details

`}
/>

</MermaidWrapper>

## Get transaction history

To provide a user with their transaction history, the client can retrieve a list of the user's <LinkOut href='/apis/resource-server/operations/list-incoming-payments/'>incoming (received) payments</LinkOut> and <LinkOut href='/apis/resource-server/operations/list-outgoing-payments/'>outgoing (sent) payments</LinkOut>.

<MermaidWrapper client:load>

<Mermaid
  graph={`sequenceDiagram

    participant C as Client
    participant RS as Resource server

    C->>RS: GET list of incoming/outgoing payments <br/>with wallet-address={URL of wallet address}
    RS-->>C: 200 OK, returns array of incoming/outgoing payments <br/>with relevant payment details

`}
/>

</MermaidWrapper>

Similarly, the client can provide the user with details about a specific <LinkOut href='/apis/resource-server/operations/get-incoming-payment'>incoming</LinkOut> or <LinkOut href='/apis/resource-server/operations/get-outgoing-payment'>outgoing</LinkOut> payment.

<MermaidWrapper client:load>

<Mermaid
  graph={`sequenceDiagram

    participant C as Client
    participant RS as Resource server

    C->>RS: GET an incoming/outgoing payment with <br/>id={URL identifying incoming/outgoing payment}
    RS-->>C: 200 incoming/outgoing payment found, <br/>returns incoming/outgoing payment details

`}
/>

</MermaidWrapper>

## Bringing it all together

This diagram brings the aforementioned concepts together, except for getting transaction history, to present a full transaction sequence without delving too deeply into the contents of each request and response. A link to view a larger version of the diagram is provided at the bottom of the page.

As shown below, both the sender and the recipient's ASEs must operate their own authorization and resource servers. Grant requests for incoming payment and quote resources are typically non-interactive. A grant request for an outgoing payment resource requires explicit consent from the sender (e.g., the client's user), which is obtained through the sender's [identity provider](/identity/idp/).

More information about grant interaction flows can be found in the [Grant negotiation and authorization](/identity/grants) page.
