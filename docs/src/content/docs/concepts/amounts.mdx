:::tip[Summary]
Amounts in Open Payments define monetary values using asset codes and asset scales. They provide a standardized way to represent money across different currencies and payment scenarios.
:::

Amounts represent monetary values and are fundamental to every Open Payments operation. Whether you're creating an incoming payment, requesting a quote, or tracking payment progress, every amount consists of three key components: a numerical `value`, an `assetCode`, and an `assetScale`. Understanding these components is crucial for building Open Payments applications.

## Values

To maximize precision and avoid rounding errors in financial calculations, Open Payments uses numerical data types without decimals to represent values. In the context of programming languages, this means that Open Payments uses unsigned 64-bit integers for monetary amounts instead of floating-point numbers.

## Asset codes

Asset codes identify the type of currency or asset being used in a payment and should follow the <LinkOut href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217'>ISO 4217</LinkOut> standard for currency representation.

An example of an ISO 4217 `assetCode` is `USD`, which represents the US Dollar.

## Asset scales

An asset scale defines the decimal precision for monetary amounts by specifying the power of 10 to divide the integer value by to get the display amount. The smallest useful unit of each currency maps to 1, with all amounts expressed as multiples of that unit.

Asset scales are numbers between 0 and 255 that represent the exponent in the conversion formula:

**Value ÷ 10<sup> `assetScale`</sup> = Display amount**

For USD with scale 2: $1.00 = 100 cents, so the scale is 2 (10² = 100).

## Amounts in Open Payments

Using the three necessary components of `value`, `assetCode`, and `assetScale`, $10 USD would be represented in Open Payments using the following structure:

```json
{
  "value": "1000",
  "assetCode": "USD",
  "assetScale": 2
}
```

This consistent structure enables multi-currency payments, precise calculations, and seamless integration between different <Tooltip content="Account servicing entity">ASEs</Tooltip>.
