:::tip[Summary]
Amounts in Open Payments define monetary values using asset codes, asset scales, and specific amount types. They provide a standardized way to represent money across different currencies and payment scenarios.
:::

Amounts represent monetary values and are fundamental to all payment operations. Every amount consists of three key components: a numerical `value`, an `assetCode`, and an `assetScale`. Understanding these components is crucial for building Open Payments applications.

Amounts are central to every Open Payments operation. Whether you're creating an incoming payment, requesting a quote, or tracking payment progress, all amounts follow the same three-part structure:

```json
{
  "value": "1000",
  "assetCode": "USD",
  "assetScale": 2
}
```

This consistent structure enables multi-currency payments, precise calculations, and seamless integration between different <Tooltip content="Account servicing entity">ASEs</Tooltip>.

:::note[Wallet address asset constraint]
[Wallet addresses](/concepts/wallet-addresses) support only one specific asset. Therefore, the amounts that can be sent or received by a particular wallet address will only be in the asset supported by that wallet. For example, a USD wallet address can only accept amounts with `assetCode: "USD"`.
:::

## Asset codes

Asset codes identify the type of currency or asset being used in a payment and should follow the <LinkOut href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217'>ISO 4217</LinkOut> standard for currency representation.

### Common currency examples

<table style='width: auto; margin: 1;'>
  <thead>

      <th>Currency</th>
      <th>Symbol</th>
    </tr>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <code>USD</code>
      </td>
      <td>US Dollar</td>
      <td>$</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <code>EUR</code>

When building payment applications, you'll specify the asset code to indicate which currency you're working with:

```json
{
  "assetCode": "USD",
  "assetScale": 2,
  "value": "1000"
}
```

## Asset scales

<<<<<<< HEAD
An asset scale tells you how many decimal places a currency uses. It's like specifying whether you're counting in dollars, cents, or smaller units.

Asset scales are numbers between 0 and 255 that indicate decimal precision.

In the case of `USD` with an `assetScale` of 2, the display amount of $100.00 is stored and represented as 10000 cents.
=======
An asset scale defines the decimal precision for monetary amounts by specifying the power of 10 to divide the integer value by to get the display amount.

### Integer representation

Open Payments uses unsigned 64-bit integers for monetary amounts instead of floating-point numbers to maximize precision and avoid rounding errors in financial calculations. The smallest useful unit of each currency maps to 1, with all amounts expressed as multiples of that unit.

### How scales work

Asset scales are integers between 0 and 255 that represent the exponent in the conversion formula:

**Monetary Value = Integer Amount ÷ 10<sup> `assetScale`</sup>**
>>>>>>> parent of 70b2464 (docs: 654/amounts-assets)

Thus, the conversion formula is:

$$\frac{\text{value}}{10^{\text{assetScale}}} = \text{display amount}$$

Using the preceding example, the formula looks like this:

$$\frac{10000}{10^2} = \frac{10000}{100} = \$100.00$$
