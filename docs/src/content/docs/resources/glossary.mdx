## Account servicing entity (ASE)

An account servicing entity provides and maintains a payment account for a sender and recipient, and is a regulated entity in the country/countries it operates.

## Asset code

A code representation of the underlying asset used to make a payment. The `assetCode` should be an <LinkOut href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217'>ISO 4217</LinkOut> currency code such as EUR (euro), MXN (Mexican peso) or USD (US dollar).

## Asset scale

The number of decimal places that defines the scale of the smallest divisible unit for the given asset code. It determines how an integer amount is scaled to derive the actual monetary value. For example, USD has an asset scale of 2 with the smallest unit being 0.01. An integer amount of `1000` with an `assetCode` of `USD` and `assetScale` of `2` translates to $10.00.

## Authorization server (AS)

An authorization server issues tokens to clients, which can then be used to perform authorized actions on resource servers. In the context of Open Payments, the authorization server grants permission for a client to access the Open Payments APIs and the `incoming-payment`, `quote`, and `outgoing-payment` resources. Open Payments leverages GNAP as the mechanism for delegating authorization.

## Client

A client is an application or service, such as a mobile or web app, that interacts with the authorization server to obtain grants and tokens. A client uses these tokens to access resources on a resource server to perform actions, such as retrieving transaction history and setting up payments, on behalf of a user or system.

## Grant Negotiation and Authorization Protocol (GNAP)

The Grant Negotiation Authorization Protocol (GNAP) defines a mechanism for delegating authorization to a piece of software, and conveying the results and artifacts of that delegation to the software. This delegation can include access to a set of APIs and subject information passed directly to the software. For more information, see the <LinkOut href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-gnap-core-protocol-12">specification</LinkOut>.

## Incoming payment resource

An [incoming payment resource](/concepts/resources/#incoming-payment) is an object created by the recipient's ASE, on their resource server, that represents a payment being received by an entity. This resource contains information about the incoming payment, such as the amount, currency, receiver's wallet address, and payment status. It's used to track and manage payments that are expected to or have been received.

## Open Payments (OP)

Open Payments is a set of open RESTful APIs that enable clients to interface with Open Payments-enabled accounts by sending and receiving payment instructions before any money movement occurs. Developers can choose to interact with the Open Payments APIs directly or use the [Open Payments SDKs](/sdk/before-you-begin) for a more streamlined integration experience.

## Outgoing payment resource

An [outgoing payment resource](/concepts/resources/#outgoing-payment) is an object created by the sender's ASE, on their resource server, that represents a payment being sent by an entity. This resource contains information about the outgoing payment, such as the amount, currency, receiver's wallet address, and payment status. Outgoing payment resources require explicit [consent](/identity/idp/) from the sender before the resource can be created.

## Payment pointer

A <LinkOut href="https://paymentpointers.org/">payment pointer</LinkOut> is a secure, unique identifier that’s assigned to payment accounts that use Interledger’s <LinkOut href='https://interledger.org/developers/rfcs/simple-payment-setup-protocol/'>Simple Payment Setup Protocol (SPSP)</LinkOut> to exchange payment information. The shorthand for a payment pointer starts with $. For example, `$wallet.example.com/alice`.

A payment pointer may serve as a [wallet address](/concepts/wallet-addresses) if Interledger is used as the payment method by transacting parties. The wallet address URL will be translated to a payment pointer when a payment is initiated over the Interledger network. However, note that not every wallet address is necessarily a payment pointer.

## Quote resource

A [quote resource](/concepts/resources/#quote) is an object created by the sender's ASE, on their resource server, after the incoming payment resource is created by the recipient's ASE. A quote resource represents a potential payment being received by an entity and contains information about the potential payment, but is mainly used to indicate the total cost, including any applicable fees, to make the payment. The quote resource also serves as a commitment from the sender's ASE to deliver a particular amount to the receiver's ASE and it only valid for a limited time.

## Resource server (RS)

A resource server hosts protected resources and enforces access controls based on the tokens provided by the authorization server. In the context of Open Payments, the resource server manages access to three payment-related resources (`incoming-payment`, `quote`, and `outgoing-payment`), ensuring that only authorized clients can perform actions through the Open Payments APIs.

## Wallet address

A [wallet address](/concepts/wallet-addresses) is a secure, sharable identifier for an Open Payments-enabled account. Wallet addresses take the form of HTTPS URLs. These URLs are service endpoints for gaining access to the Open Payments APIs. Querying a wallet address provides details about the underlying Open Payments-enabled account.
