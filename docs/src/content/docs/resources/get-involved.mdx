## Community and hackathons

- Join us at the <LinkOut href="https://interledger.org/summit">Interledger Summit</LinkOut> and participate in our annual hackathon.
- Organize your own hackathons, coding sprints, and workshops, both online and offline. Here's a few ideas to inspire you:
  - Create an e-commerce application with a "Pay with Open Payments" flow
  - Build a subscription service built with Open Payments APIs
  - Develop an application that uses pay-as-you-go and takes advantage of the Open Payments grant APIs, which give access for an application to gradually make payments from user accounts, up to a limit
  - Port the <LinkOut href="https://github.com/interledger/open-payments/tree/main/packages/open-payments">Open Payments SDK</LinkOut> to another programming language (the current SDK was built with Node.js and TypeScript)

  - Arabic
  - Chinese
  - French
  - German
  - Japanese
