Invoices represent an amount payable that can be presented to a third party
and/or a Mandate to pay.

## Resource Representation

The `application/json` representation of an invoice resource provides the
details of the invoice as a JSON document.

| Property    | Type     | Description                                                                   |
| ----------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| id          | URL      | The URL identifying the invoice                                               |
| account     | URL      | The account into which payments toward the invoice will be credited           |
| amount      | int64    | The amount that must be paid at the time the invoice is created               |
| assetCode   | string   | The asset code of the amount (inherited from the underlying account)          |
| assetScale  | int32    | The scale of the amount (inherited from the underlying account)               |
| received    | int64    | The amount that has been paid toward the invoice since it was created         |
| expiresAt   | DateTime | The date and time when payments toward the invoice will no longer be accepted |

## APIs

The invoices API endpoint is relative to the account that is being paid using
the sub-resource URL: **`./invoices`**

Specifically, the URL of the invoices API endpoint is the result of performing
the URL parsing algorithm in
[WHATWG URL](https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#url-parsing) where:

- _input_ is `./invoices`, and
- _base_ is the account URL

For example, for the account URL `https://wallet.example/alice` the invoices API
endpoint for that account is `https://wallet.example/alice/invoices`

### Create

A client creates an invoice by doing an HTTP POST of a JSON document to the
invoices API endpoint.

The JSON document MUST include the following:

- amount
- expiresAt

and MAY include the following:

- description

The Open Payments server MUST respond with a `201 Created` response or an error
(TDB). The response MUST contain the newly created invoice and a `Location`
response header with the URL of the newly created invoice.

If the client specifies an alternative media-type in the `Accept` header, as
defined in the [payment details API](./payments), then the payment details
should be returned as part of the response.

The following is a non-normative example where the client creates an invoice for
the Payment Pointer `$wallet.example/alice`:

```http
POST /alice/invoices HTTP/1.1
Host: wallet.example
Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJodHRwOi...
Accept: application/json
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "amount": 200,
  "description": "Paying for goods"
}
```

with a non-normative response from the Open Payments server:

```http
HTTP/1.1 201 Created
Content-Type: application/json
Location: https://wallet.example/invoices/0f09dc92-84ad-401b-a7c9-441bc6173f4e

{
  "id": "https://wallet.example/invoices/0f09dc92-84ad-401b-a7c9-441bc6173f4e",
  "account": "https://wallet.example/alice",
  "amount": 200,
  "assetCode": "USD",
  "assetScale": 2,
  "description": "Paying for goods"
  "received": 0
}
```

### Get

The client reads the invoice by doing an HTTP GET of the corresponding invoice
URL. The Open Payments server MUST respond with either an invoice or an error
(TBD).

The following is a non-normative example where the client reads an invoice:

```http
GET /invoices/0f09dc92-84ad-401b-a7c9-441bc6173f4e HTTP/1.1
Host: wallet.example
Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJodHRwOi...
Accept: application/json
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "id": "https://wallet.example/invoices/0f09dc92-84ad-401b-a7c9-441bc6173f4e",
  "account": "https://wallet.example/alice",
  "amount": 200,
  "assetCode": "USD",
  "assetScale": 2,
  "description": "Paying for goods",
  "received": 158
}
```

### Payment Details

The client gets the payment details of an invoice by doing an HTTP GET of the
invoice URL as defined in the [payment details API](./payments).

The following is a non-normative example of a client getting the payment details
for an invoice:

```http
GET invoices/0f09dc92-84ad-401b-a7c9-441bc6173f4e HTTP/1.1
Host: wallet.example
Accept: application/ilp-stream+json
```

with a non-normative response from the Open Payments Server of:

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/ilp-stream+json

{
  "id": "https://wallet.example/invoices/0f09dc92-84ad-401b-a7c9-441bc6173f4e",
  "account": "https://wallet.example/alice",
  "amount": 200,
  "assetCode": "USD",
  "assetScale": 2,
  "description": "Paying for goods",
  "ilpAddress": "example.alice.YB5X9FhSOUPCL~NjZjZTYwZDgtZjRiYS00YzYwLWJhNmUtZmM1ZTBhYTk5OTIz",
  "sharedSecret": "6jR5iNIVRvqeasJeCty6C+YB5X9FhSOUPCL/5nha5Vs="
}
```
